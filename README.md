###This is currently not finished 

There are some things that I wnated to implement into this homework that I currently did not complete. What you will find is the pseudo code of what could have been and what will be. But before I get to that, lets talk about what I currently have. 

Right now, I have a data scraper, that gets pushed into my database, and is then displayed on the front end. I have npt been able to get to the point of creating a post it note or anything of the sort. 

I'm using several dependencies for this to work properly. These including: 

1. express.js
2. mongojs
 
 express.js is used for simple routing. making it possible to use specific commands to allow the scraping to occur as well as routing through the website what I get it running.

3. request
4. and cheerio

The latter two is what is recuired to scrape the data from my chosen website. cheerio making it substantially easier to grab data that is on the website by essentially using jquery syntax on the server side.


I would like to hose this on heroku when I figure that out. Its gonna be fantastic once I'm capable of doing just that.
